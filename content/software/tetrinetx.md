This patch includes all Gentoo patches for this version of TetrinetX server at the time, as well as mine.
Mine adds the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| /go | mark you as ready-to-play, so the game can start when all players type /go |
| /ungo | undo your 'ready' status |
| /ready | see who's ready |
| /forcego | start the game with the players who are ready (only), so you don't have to wait for all of them to become ready. only the "chanop" can use this command |
