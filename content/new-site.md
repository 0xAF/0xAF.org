It's been 10 years or so...  
Eventually I've decided to make a new site.  
Mostly because the old one was a Perl CGI script, which I haven't updated to many years and the for the new server I'm running Nginx, so I was too lazy to do the fastcgi/fcgiwrap configuration only to run my old site.  
For long time now, I wanted to use something simple for the site. To ease me as much as possible.  
So I ended up with [Zola](https://getzola.org). A static site generator, which seems to be what I need. Simple and yet advanced enough.  
And in the end, I found that I can easily put the site in CloudFlare Pages... so it turns out I dont need my server for that either.
