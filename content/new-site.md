It has been some 10 years or so...  
Eventually I've decided to make a new site.  
And since I'm too lazy to update it, I wanted to use something simple for the site. To ease me as much as possible.  
So I ended up with [Zola](https://getzola.org). A static site generator, which seems to be what I need. Simple and yet advanced enough.
