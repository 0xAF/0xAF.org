I have [contributed JS Plugins](https://github.com/luarvique/openwebrx/commit/9880cd8783951a53d7d1520febe7bd7e2b67c46e) for the WEB interface of [OWRX+](https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/) receiver and map pages.  
Since the plugins can be loaded externaly from url, this gives me the opportunity to update them, without touching the main code, hence not waiting for Marat to accept and publish the changes.  
I have many ideas for plugins and they will be realized in the time. Keep an eye on the plugins page.

You can find [my plugins here](https://0xaf.github.io/openwebrxplus-plugins/) and their [source code here](https://github.com/0xAF/openwebrxplus-plugins)
